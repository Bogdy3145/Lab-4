----

Continue working on the application from the previous assignment. Push your project to this repository.

You will need to:
- Add unit tests for the two non-CRUD functionalities from the previous assignments.
- Create an account on https://aws.amazon.com/free/ (or equivalent) and deploy your project to a virtual machine. It should be usable by anyone with a link to it. You do not need to worry about security and performance at this point.
- Add at least `3` validation rules (in total) for one or more entity's attributes.
